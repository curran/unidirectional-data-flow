# unidirectional-data-flow
Unidirectional Data Flow for Vanilla JavaScript

The `unidirectional-data-flow` package provides is a lightweight JavaScript library designed to implement the popular unidirectional data flow pattern popularized by React, but more specifically targeted towards use with D3.js for interactive data visualization. A primary feature of the library is its framework-agnostic nature, making it highly adaptable and capable of being wrapped as components in any framework such as Vue, Svelte, React or Angular.

## Features

- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Simplify your state and data handling in your application by adopting a one-way data flow model.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Integrates seamlessly with any existing or new JavaScript project, regardless of the framework used.
- **Enhanced with D3.js**: Tailored specifically for data visualization using D3.js, but not limited to it.
- **Component Compatibility**: Easily wrap the functionality as components in your preferred framework.
- **Simplicity and Minimalism**: Focused on doing one thing well with an easy-to-understand API and minimal overhead.
